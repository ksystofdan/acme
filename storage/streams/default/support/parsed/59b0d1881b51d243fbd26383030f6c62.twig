<p>Commenting on the leading trends in warehousing automation for 2023, Narayan said: “Robots are playing a significant role in warehouses. They can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as sorting, picking, packaging, and fulfillment. We foresee an increased use of cobots that will work in collaboration with humans to complete mundane tasks. Cobots will assist distribution centres to achieve higher productivity while keeping costs and manpower use to a minimum.”
