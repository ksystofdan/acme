<p><strong>How can robotic solutions provide smaller companies with significant competitive advantages?</strong></p><p>The investment for a basic yet efficient industrial robotic solution typically pays off within 3.8 years on average, for larger installations this period shortens. As a rule of thumb, if a robot replaces just 3 headcounts, the return on investment is already higher when implementing automation. Traditionally larger higher throughput production facilities invested in industrial robotics on their shop floor in order to reduce manpower utilisation as well as to boost production throughput.&nbsp;</p><p>With the advent of collaborative robotics solutions, small businesses operating with limited shop floor space can incorporate robotics to help with pick and place operations, palletisation as well as routine assembly work. The added advantage of cobots is that they are easily configurable and can be redeployed easily without much support from system integrators.</p>
