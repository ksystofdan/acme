<p><strong>What new services and initiatives have you introduced during the year? What new concepts is Acme planning to introduce in future?</strong></p><p></p><p>We have grown our range of products that we design and manufacture in the UAE extensively over the past year. In our R&D facility in Jebel Ali, we have developed a complete range of tote as well as pallet conveyor systems, automated storage and retrieval solutions such as stacker cranes as well as high density pallet shuttle systems. We intend to continue expanding our range as we see the need for manufacturing intralogistics solutions in the region, to allow for faster implementation and customised solutions that can only be warranted by an on-ground provider.</p>
<p>We are also in advanced stages of developing AGV solutions for pallet movement and expect to bring it to market soon. Besides, we have expanded our distribution partnerships with world-class manufacturers and are continuing to build new partnerships. We have recently tied up with Hanwha Robotics to launch their collaborative robotics solutions in the region and look forward to working with local businesses who want to take small steps into automation and would like to invest in highly customisable and user-friendly robotic systems.</p>
