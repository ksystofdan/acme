<p><strong>What have been the major achievements, milestones and special developments of the year 2020-21 at Acme?</strong></p>
<p>It goes without saying, 2020 and the pandemic brought economic challenges with it. We have managed to maintain and grow our business and increase our in-house capacities, which we consider a major achievement. We also managed to continue growing our system integration vertical, and improved our in-house production capacities. With new regulations around social distancing and safety, a lot of our customers are investing more in automation, which has triggered increased demand in this sector.</p>
<p>While travel restrictions have made it harder for us to mobilise our team of engineers to regional installation sites, we have been able to cut down installation time by pre-assembling a large part of the system in-house prior to shipping to site. We were awarded a project in Saudi Arabia to design and deliver one of the largest automated warehouse systems for the regionâ€™s largest retail and fashion operator.</p>
<p>The project is currently in installation and should go live by mid-2022. We were also awarded a project to deliver a high-speed product sorter for one of the largest supermarket retailers in the region. The system is expected to go live in Aug 2021 and will be able to sort over 7000 cases of fresh produce per hour.</p>
<p>We have greatly enhanced our design and delivery capabilities in the last one year and look forward to providing state of the art locally designed and manufactured solutions to the regional market.</p>
