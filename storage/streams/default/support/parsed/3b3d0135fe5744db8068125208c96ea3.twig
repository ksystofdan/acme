<p>Navin Narayan added,&nbsp;“This will be very useful for logistics and manufacturing sectors. For instance, in a large warehousing facility, many cases need to be depalletized and the process is complex, which requires high speed and stability. The traditional industrial robots cannot deal well with random pallet patterns and many cartons in various sizes and shapes. Using AI algorithm, our vision-guided robot will be able to easily recognize dark or white objects, tapes, cable ties, labeled objects, and the direction of stripes on cartons; and thus, automatically complete depalletizing and palletizing in an efficient and prompt manner.”</p>
<p>Acme’s customers can benefit from fast access to innovative vision-based solutions incorporating Mech-Eye industrial 3D cameras, Mech-Vision graphical machine vision software, Mech-DLK offline deep learning training tool, Mech-Viz intelligent robot programming environment and more.&nbsp;

<p>By integrating with industrial robots as well as collaborative robots from Hanwha, Acme can provide a wide range of palletization, depalletization, machine tending as well as sortation and bin picking solutions for both manufacturing and intralogistics industries.
