<p>Navin Narayan added,&nbsp;“We increasingly focused on robotics, specifically cobot solutions, through new partnerships with companies like Hanwha and OnRobot, as well as manufacturing customised mechanical grippers in-house. The disruption in supply chain due to the pandemic has encouraged more companies in the region to rely on local warehousing solution providers and, going forward, I believe this trend will continue.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further achievements in 2021 include providing automation solutions for the largest regional fashion retailer for their distribution centre in Saudi Arabia and implementing a high speed robotic palletisation system for one of the biggest dairy product manufacturers in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Acme has also increased investment in the company’s in-house R&D and manufacturing departments. This has led to the expansion of product range by Acme, like High Density Pallet Storage System, Radio Shuttle and Pallet Quality Check Stations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In 2021, Acme also recorded positive response from the industry at its booths in major trade shows - Seamless Middle East, Materials Handling, Gulfood Manufacturing, India Warehousing Show and the SCLG summit. The company renewed its ISO certifications including ISO 9001:2015, ISO 45001: 2018, and ISO 14001:2015, as part of its ongoing commitment to maintaining quality standards.
