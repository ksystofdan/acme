<p>According to Navin Narayan, CEO of Acme Intralog: “Automation technology is pivotal to optimising warehousing operations for industries, and we are proud to say that our technology and services have helped to strengthen the regional retail, e-commerce and manufacturing sectors. Among our notable achievements in 2022 are setting up fully automated storage facilities in UAE and Saudi Arabia for one of the biggest e-commerce companies worldwide and the completion of the largest palletisation system in the region for a F&B distribution centre.

<p>Commenting on the leading trends in warehousing automation for 2023, Narayan said: “Robots are playing a significant role in warehouses. They can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as sorting, picking, packaging, and fulfillment. We foresee an increased use of cobots that will work in collaboration with humans to complete mundane tasks. Cobots will assist distribution centres to achieve higher productivity while keeping costs and manpower use to a minimum.”
