<p>As e-commerce industry in the region experiences exponential growth rates, it becomes imperative to enhance efficiency and safety of warehouses to ensure smooth operations. UAE based Acme Intralog is taking the lead in helping regional companies improve their warehouse productivity using collaborative cobots. The company has entered into an agreement with Korea based Hanwha Corporation and Denmark based OnRobot to provide cobot solutions that make it quicker and simpler to automate tasks such as packaging, materials handling and assembly.<br></p>
<p>Navin Narayan, CEO, Acme Intralog, says: “Cobots are changing the nature of fulfillment in warehouses as they work with humans to complete repetitive tasks. This allows employees to focus on more revenue generating tasks. They also improve worker safety as the cobots can be used to handle repetitive tasks, thus protecting workers from lower back injuries while minimizing shopfloor space requirement. They can also be incorporated into advanced order picking solutions using Vision technologies that are complemented with Artificial Intelligence. Cobots can skyrocket warehouse operation speeds at the same time generate quick return on investment. With technological innovations in the logistics space, cobots are getting better at what they do, and are an asset to every warehouse.”

<p>The collaborative robots from Hanwha are easy to control and flexible in responding to changes in production and operation layout, effectively cutting investment cost and operating expenses. They can be easily set up for tasks such as loading, palletizing, and order picking while at the same time not requiring the programming skills and perimeter safety requirements of industrial robots.

<p>In collaboration with OnRobot, Acme offers a wide assortment of tools for collaborative applications, including electric and vacuum grippers, force/torque sensors, a 2.5D vision system, screwdriver, sander kits and tool changers. This combination of offerings makes it quicker and simpler to automate tasks such as packaging, quality control, materials handling, machine tending, packaging, assembly, and surface finishing.
