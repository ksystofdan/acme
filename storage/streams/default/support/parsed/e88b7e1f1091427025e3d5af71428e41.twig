<p>Kanghar, a high-density pallet shuttle from Acme is the company’s latest addition to their Automated Storage & Retrieval Systems (ASRS) portfolio. Exclusively produced by Acme’s inhouse team, Kanghar is best suited for dense warehouses as they allow customers to make best use of their space both vertically and horizontally. The Kanghar system consists of one pallet shuttle placed on top of a larger carrier shuttle.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom shuttle carries the shuttle on the top along the rails and stops at the desired aisle. The smaller shuttle then disengages itself from the system and advances into the aisle to pick up or drop the pallet and returns to the bottom shuttle and together they continue their journey to the destination where the pallet needs to be offloaded or picked up. The solution is designed for use in high density, high throughput low SKU distribution centers.</p>
