<p><strong>What collaborations does Acme have with companies including those based in the West? Are you planning any new alliances/joint ventures internationally?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We have established partnerships with a number of high-quality suppliers predominantly from Europe over the past years already. For most, we are the exclusive distributor in the region, which helps shortening delivery times of their parts for our customers drastically, while we also rely on the parts of some of these partners when designing our own solutions.</p><p>To name a few: Axelent, a Sweden-based safety specialist and provider for industrial fencing and machine guarding; Schmalz innovative vacuum handling systems from Germany; Optimus Sorters, a Dutch specialist for sortation solutions; Habasit, the world’s number one when it comes to belting from Switzerland; Leuze, a reliable German producer of sensor technology; Metalwork Pneumatic Italy providing quality pneumatic components; Kardex Remstar, dynamic storage and retrieval systems made in Switzerland; and Hanwha Robotics – Collaborative robotic solutions from S. Korea.</p>
<p>We will soon be announcing a few more exciting new partnerships very soon as we expand our automation vertical further.</p>
