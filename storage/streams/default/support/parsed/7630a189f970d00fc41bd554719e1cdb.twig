<p><strong>How can a company begin its warehouse automation system?</strong></p><p>Every business has its own workflow and processes in place. In turn, it has its own peculiar bottlenecks. Before embarking on automating their facility, the operations team needs to prepare a detailed as-is workflow process as well as identify current pain points. Having access to historical inventory movement data as well as projected future volumes is mandatory to develop a customised automated warehouse solution that delivers quick ROI as well as simplifies operational workflow within the warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the data has been compiled the team can sit with the planning team of a trusted automation vendor and design a tailor made solution. The solution needs to be thoroughly simulated and tested with multiple scenarios in order to ensure that the concept designed caters to current as well as future volumes. I personally do not believe that an automated facility can be designed from the scratch upwards, with just one meeting between the customer and the automation vendor.</p>
