<p><strong>What was Acme Intralog's approximate turnover in 2020? To what would you attribute the increase or decrease in the turnover What is your expected turnover in 2021?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>We had an over 20 per cent increase on YoY turnover between 2019 and 2020. With businesses focusing on incorporating automation into their manufacturing and warehouse operations we expect a similar increase of top line in 2021 in comparison to 2020. The added focus on industrialisation in the region gives us confidence in the growth of the automation industry throughout MENA. With the opening of our sales office in Germany, we look forward to delivering automation components to solution integrators in Europe. We expect this to grow substantially and will be part of our long-term focus too.</p>
