<p>Navin Narayan added,&nbsp;“The carrier shuttle in the Kanghar system moves up or down the main aisle of the rack towards the side aisle where the pallet should be stored. Then the pallet shuttle which essentially holds the pallet moves off the system and into the depth of the rack to the right or left to place the pallet in its location. For retrieval, it’s essentially the same process. Kanghar can move standard pallets (EPAL1, 2 and 3, CP pallets) as well as customised pallets up to 2,000 kg in weight. With our ‘Polar’ range of models, such units can easily be deployed in freezer environments too.”</p>
<p>Kanghar can achieve a speed of approx. 2.6m / sec for the carrier shuttle and 1m/sec for the pallet shuttle. This will enhance the warehouse efficiency drastically. The full solution is typically built around the storage and retrieval processes, including the inbound and outbound conveyors, pallet lifts, control units and Warehouse Control System (WCS). Acme can also set up the racking and Warehouse Management System (WMS) for any warehouse, if required.
